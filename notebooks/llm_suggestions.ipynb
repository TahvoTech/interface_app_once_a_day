      "   - Moderate profitability potential through subscription plans or one-time purchases.\n",
      "   - Medium complexity in terms of development, requiring basic AI and behavior-tracking features.\n",
      "   - High user engagement potential due to its value in improving productivity.\n",
      "   - Short development time, ranging from a few months to a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. EcoGenius (High Relevance, High Profitability, Medium Complexity, High User Engagement, Medium Development Time)\n",
      "   - An eco-conscious shopping application that provides personalized product recommendations based on sustainable and environmentally friendly brands.\n",
      "   - High relevance due to the growing consumer demand for sustainable and eco-friendly products.\n",
      "   - High profitability potential through commission fees from referred product sales.\n",
      "   - Medium complexity involved in developing personalized recommendation algorithms and managing brand partnerships.\n",
